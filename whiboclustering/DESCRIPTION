Description: White Box Cluster Algorithm Design 
    allows you to create Representative based cluster algorithm
    by using reusable components. This way one can recreate already
    available cluster algorithms (i.e. K-Means, K-Means++, PAM) but 
    also create new cluster algorithms not available in the literature
    or any other software.
